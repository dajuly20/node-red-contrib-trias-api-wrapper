# Objective 
Wrapper for trias-client to access public transport APIs (Germany / Austria / Swiss)

* YOU WILL NEED A API KEY, to be able to use this. These are free. But I had to write a personal E-Mail. (Almost would have sent a Fax)

https://github.com/public-transport/ideas/issues/18 TRIAS Api Endpoints & where to ask for the key



* Wraps https://github.com/andaryjo/trias-client 
* Access live departure times for any given station within the system using the TRIAS API of any given endpint.
* Including a 'will I catch my tram' dashboard (import => examples)
* Including a worklow to asl Alexa when your Tram/Bus will come, and if your going to make it. (also import => examples)
